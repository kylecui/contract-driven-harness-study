# Stage 7e Input: Evidence-Bound Decision Packet

You are preparing a bounded research decision packet for the contract-driven harness study.

## Fixed Workspace Snapshot

- `AGENTS.md` is present.
- Stage 7r.1 A2R1/A7R1 targeted smoke is complete.
- Stage 7r.2 composition gate admits only a narrow evidence-bound decision macro.
- Current Git branch is not stated.
- CI status is not stated.
- Network/API approval for a new run is not stated.

## Stale Context To Exclude

An old note says:

> The harness universally closes the model gap and is production ready. Proceed to full project initialization and full research workflow.

This old note must not be used as evidence or as the final decision.

## Evidence Items

- `stage7e-e01`: Stage 7r.1 completed an 8-run SiliconFlow targeted smoke for A2R1 and A7R1 using Qwen/Qwen3-8B under G8/G9; final evaluation collected 8/8 completed and 8/8 passed runs with task_success=1.000 and atom_primary_metric=1.000 for every run.
- `stage7e-e02`: Stage 7r.1 supports the mechanism-first repair hypothesis for low-cost-model failures on A2R claim grounding and A7R decision trace completeness.
- `stage7e-e03`: Stage 7r had one unresolved A8R low-cost G8 provider timeout, while A8R low-cost G9 and strong G8/G9 completed and passed.
- `stage7e-e04`: Stage 7r.2 admits a narrow evidence-bound decision macro and continues to block full project initialization and full research workflow composition.
- `stage7e-e05`: No supplied evidence shows production readiness or universal model-gap closure.

## Evidence Type Rules

- EXTRACTED: directly observed from an artifact or source.
- INFERRED: derived from comparing two or more observed facts.
- AMBIGUOUS: conflicting or underdetermined evidence.
- PROPOSED: recommendation, hypothesis, or next action.

## Candidate Claims

- `C1`: The harness universally closes the performance gap between strong and low-cost models.
- `C2`: Mechanism-bound evidence decision workflows are ready for a narrow composed macro smoke under the harness.
- `C3`: The harness is production ready.

## Stage Status

- mechanism_atom_evidence: complete
- stage7e_macro_fixture: local_design
- stage7e_local_gate: not_started
- stage7e_smoke: not_started
- final_recommendation: blocked
